This time we used the function `predict_proba` that retruns the certainty of the prediction as a probability. Finally, sentence 3 was not correctly classified. The correct label would be `Film`, since the sentence is from famous scene of a very good film. If by any chance, you don't know [what I'm talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwT60UbOZnI), well, please put your priorities in order.

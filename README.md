# Sciblog support information and code
This repo contains the projects, additional information and code to support my blog: [sciblog](https://miguelgfierro.com/).

## Notebook projects

* [Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/miguelgfierro/sciblog_support/tree/master/A_Gentle_Introduction_to_CNN): In this project we explain what is a convolution and how to compute a CNN using MXNet deep learning library with the MNIST character recognition dataset. Here the [blog entry](https://miguelgfierro.com/blog/2016/a-gentle-introduction-to-convolutional-neural-networks/).

* [Visualization of Football Matches with Datashader](https://github.com/miguelgfierro/sciblog_support/blob/master/Visualization_of_Football_Matches/visualization_football.md): In this notebook we explain how to visualize all matches in the UEFA Champions League since its beginning using the python library datashader. To create the project we use the Lean Startup method. Here the [blog entry](https://github.com/miguelgfierro/sciblog_support/blob/master/Visualization_of_Football_Matches/visualization_football.md).

* [Introduction to Natural Language Processing with fastText](https://github.com/miguelgfierro/sciblog_support/blob/master/Intro_to_NLP_with_fastText/Intro_to_NLP.ipynb). In this project we show how to implement text classification, sentiment analysis and word embedding using the library fastText. We also show a way to represent the word embeddings in a reduced space using t-SNE algorithm.
